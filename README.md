# Analysis_of_the_course_of_the_Coronavirus_pandemic

## Description
The goal of the project was to analyze data related to the course of the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide. After installing and importing all necessary libraries, the data were loaded and analyzed. The statistics examined included population, average life expectancy, new cases of COVID-19 in specific countries, and the number of infected individuals in different countries (map chart). 
Then, using the Dash library, three dashboards summarizing the obtained results were created.

### Dashboard 1
Two line plots: 
1. Cummulative number of positive cases
2. Cummulative number of deaths

### Dashboard 2
Interactive map graph with the ability to choose a continent and a statistic:
- total cases
- total deaths
- total tests
- total vaccinations
- number of fully vaccinated people

### Dashboard 3
Two bar plots the ability to choose a number of countries to display:
1. Ranking of countries with the greatest number of vaccinations
2. Ranking of countries with the best vaccination ratio
